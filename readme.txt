Tic Tac Toe game assignment for SSH Communications Security 
- Frontend code is written in Javascript, HTML & CSS in the "static" and "templates" folders.
- No extra libraries have been used. 
- For simplicity, the game assumes the player who starts first always plays the "X" mark
- This solution code also fixed a Python backend error in the file game.py from the assignment itself, which made the game draw in the last move even when one player obtained 3 marks in a line.

- The live web app is deployed in Azure with Docker, Azure Container Registry and Azure App Server (using the same backend logic in Python): https://sshtictactoe.azurewebsites.net/
